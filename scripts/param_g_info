#Interatomic length between atoms, set to 1.4 Angstroms for graphene
#Length of sheet in the x direction (Angstroms) ,lx
#Length of sheet in the y direction (Angstroms) ,ly
#Radius of curvature of the fold (Angstroms) ,r1
#Length of sheet on top half of folded sheet (Angstroms) ,r2
#Twist angle (Degrees), theta
#Switch for periodic sheets in the y-direction, 0 for non-periodic and 1 for periodic. For theta other than 0 and 30, the sheet gets minor alterations to the width and angle to make sheet periodic.
#Extra width for tearing simulations
#x dimension of Si substrate s_lx
#y dimension of Si substrate s_ly
#z dimenston of Si substrate s_lz
#Flag for presence of water, if 0 there will be no water
