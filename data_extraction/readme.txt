Files for extracting information from sliding graphene simulations.

In depth information extracted from paper

Reads co-ordinates and velocities of atoms from graphene_xyz_v.lammpstrj file and timestep info from INPUT file.

Prints out Distance.dat file which contains time(ps), intelayer spacing (Angstroms) and distance between short edges of the folded sheet.

Also prints out velocity.dat file which contains time(ps) and velocity difference between top and bottom sheets (A/ps)
